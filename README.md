# Ruby Command Line Interface Project

This is a simple command line interface program that simulates playing blackjack at a casino.

You enter your name and wager amount, then begin the game of blackjack. 
The game is just between you and the dealer. 

To keep things simple, you hit by entering 1, and pass by entering 2
(any input besides 2 really would just count as a pass)

Try out this object oriented game and see how much money you could win! 
Your starting amount is $500

- Ruby version: `3.2.1`
- Run by entering ```BlackJack.rb``` into the terminal
